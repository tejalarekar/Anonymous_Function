# Anonymous_Function

An anonymous function, also known as a lambda function, is a function that is defined without a name. In Python, anonymous functions are created using the lambda keyword, followed by the function's arguments, a colon, and the function's expression. The expression is evaluated and returned when the function is called.

Here is an example of an anonymous function that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns the result of adding them:

lambda x, y: x + y
Because anonymous functions do not have a name, they are often used in situations where a function is needed only once, such as in the examples I've given before. They can be used as arguments to higher-order functions, such as map(), filter(), reduce(), and sorted().

For example, you can use an anonymous function as the key argument in the sorted() function to sort a list of strings by their length:

words = ['cat', 'dog', 'giraffe', 'elephant']
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda x: len(x))
You can also assign an anonymous function to a variable, so you can use it later:

add = lambda x, y: x + y
result = add(3, 4)
In Python, anonymous functions are limited to a single expression, unlike named functions which can have multiple expressions and statements. They are often used to write small, throwaway functions, or to provide a function as an argument to another function.
