# Anonymous_Function

In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function, which can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The syntax for creating a lambda function is as follows:

lambda arguments: expression
The arguments are passed to the function on the left side of the colon, and the expression on the right side is evaluated and returned. For example, the following lambda function takes a single argument x and returns its square:

lambda x: x**2
Lambda functions are often used in combination with other built-in functions such as map(), filter() and reduce() to perform operations on lists and other iterables. For example, the following code uses the map() function to square every element in a list using a lambda function:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
Lambda functions are also commonly used in conjunction with sorting, where a lambda function is passed to the sort() method to define a custom sorting key.

pairs = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]
pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
Lambda functions can also be used as a short-hand notation for defining small, throwaway functions. They can be useful when you need to pass a small function as an argument to another function, but you don't want to define a separate named function for it.
